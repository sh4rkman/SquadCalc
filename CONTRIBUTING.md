# Contributing

Thank you for considering contributing to this project! üôè

## 1. Open an Issue/Discussion first

‚ö†Ô∏è **Before creating a pull request, please open an [Issue](https://github.com/sh4rkman/SquadCalc/issues) or start a [Discussion](https://github.com/sh4rkman/SquadCalc/discussions) for new features** ‚ö†Ô∏è  

This helps me make sure that the feature aligns with the project‚Äôs goals and avoids wasted work.  
**Exceptions:** Simple fixes, typos, or translations do not require an issue first.

## 2. Target the Development Branch

‚ö†Ô∏è  **All pull requests should target the development branch (`dev`), not `master`.** ‚ö†Ô∏è  

Your PR will first be tested and merged with the current under-development features before eventually making it to `master`.

### How to create a PR
1. Fork the repository (if needed)
2. Create a branch from `dev`:


```bash
git checkout dev
git checkout -b my-feature
```

3. Make your changes and commit them
4. Push your branch and open a pull request targeting dev
5. Wait for review and approval before merging
6. After merging, your PR will be automatically pushed to https://beta.squadcalc.app/
